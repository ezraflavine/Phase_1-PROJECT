# Phase_1-PROJECT

# Movie Data Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for exploring movie data from various sources. The goal of this project is to gain insights into successful movie trends and provide actionable recommendations for Microsoft's new movie studio.

# Business Problem

Microsoft wants to enter the entertainment industry by creating a new movie studio. However, they lack knowledge about creating successful movies. The objective of this analysis is to explore existing movie data and identify trends related to successful movies at the box office. The insights gained from this analysis will help Microsoft's movie studio to decide what type of films to produce to maximize revenue and success.

# Data Sources

The analysis is based on the following movie datasets:

IMDb Title Basics: This dataset contains basic information about movie titles, including genre, runtime, and release year.

IMDb Title Ratings: This dataset provides ratings and votes information for movies.

Box Office Mojo: This dataset includes domestic and international gross revenue for movies.

# Analysis Steps Data Loading

The three datasets are loaded and combined to create a comprehensive movie dataset using pandas merge.

# Data Cleaning
The datasets are cleaned to handle missing values, remove duplicates, remove spaces and characters, and ensure data consistency.

Genre Analysis: The distribution of movie genres is explored to identify popular genres and their performance at the box office.

Ratings vs. Revenue: The relationship between movie ratings and revenue are examined to understand the impact of ratings on box office success.
    
# Business Problems

1. Establish and understand the relationship between ratings and revenue of different genres.
We have established that there is no relationship between ratings and revenue of different genres.

2. Movie Release Year Trends
The trend in movie release years is analyzed to identify any patterns or shifts in the industry.

3. Profitable Genres and the most successful studios
The most profitable movie genres are identified based on revenue generated and the popular movies going by the number of votes.

4. Exploring International market opportunities of the movies
Analyze the possibilities of more opportunities in foreign markets.

# Visualization

Visualizations such as bar plots, line graphs, and swarm plots are used to present the findings effectively.

# Recommendations

Microsoft should;

1. Focus on popular genres which are highly rated and highly voted for to increase chances of success.
2. Explore partnerships with international markets since foreign revenue is higher than domestic revenue.
3. Focus on high revenue generating studios to learn from them such as Buena Vista, Fox, and Warner Bros.
4. Study the trend in movie release years.
